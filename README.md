# Github Portfolio Workshop

## About Me

I have been at Pursuit teaching iOS development for the past 3 years. Prior to Pursuit I worked as an iOS developer at an App Agency in New York City called SWARM NYC. There I worked on small, mid size and larger scale apps. Github is the most important tools you can use to capture a potential employer's interest.

## 1. Certification Checklist 

As employers read your resume and continue on to explore your Github and projects your goal is to make it shine and standout. Below we will get started with some Github must haves. 

- [ ] Github profile photo.
- [ ] Add bio.
- [ ] Pinned projects of most up to date / interesting projects. (Snowman and Text Based Adventure if in module 1).
- [ ] README's for all pinned projects (If someone else created the repo for your team make sure to fork the repo then pin it to your profile). 

## 2. Objectives 

1. Update Pinned repos with most current and relevant work. 
2. Create README's for all of your Pinned projects. 
3. Create a README for your main Github profile that adds more value to your Github landing page. 

## 3. Basics of a README 

1. Description of the application. 
2. Instructions needed to run the project. 
3. Code snippet of the most challenging part or a part you were most proud of working on the project. 

```javascript
console.log('Code Snippet')
```

4. Names of collaborators if any and a description of their contribution to the project. 
5. List of frameworks, third party libraries used on the project. 
6. Credit to resources used, e.g StackOverflow article or Medium post. 
7. Screenshots of the application.
8. A gif of an interesting part of the application, using an application like [GIPHY Capture](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/giphy-capture-the-gif-maker/id668208984?mt=12). 

## 4. Adding a README to your Github Profile

[alexpaul/alexpaul](https://github.com/alexpaul/alexpaul) is a special repository: its README.md will appear on your profile!

1. Create a repository with the same name as your Github username e.g my username is `alexpaul` so I would create a repo named `alexpaul`.
2. Edit and add content to the newly created README.

## 5. Where to next 

1. Best way to grow as a developer is to view code from other credible developers. 
2. Star repos that were useful to you or that you're interested in exploring.
3. Read up on open source and how to get started. [Open source guide](https://opensource.guide/)
